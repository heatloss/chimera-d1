# Migration Complete - chimera-cms to chimera-d1

## Summary

Successfully migrated all content from the legacy chimera-cms to the new chimera-d1 Payload CMS instance.

## What Was Migrated

### Database Content
- **2 Users** - Migrated with temporary passwords (documented in `backups/temp-passwords-*.txt`)
- **1 Comic** - "The Automan's Daughter"
- **5 Chapters** - Complete chapter structure
- **29 Pages** - All pages with full metadata and navigation relationships
- **42 Media Files** - Images uploaded to both local and remote R2

### Media Assets
- Original images uploaded to R2 (both local miniflare and remote Cloudflare)
- Database records created with proper metadata
- Page-to-media relationships established
- File metadata populated (filesize, width, height)

## Migration Scripts Created

1. **scripts/migrate-from-chimera-cms.ts** - Main migration script
   - Migrates users, comics, chapters, pages
   - Converts UUID-based IDs to INTEGER IDs
   - Generates secure temporary passwords
   - Maintains all relationships

2. **scripts/direct-insert-media.ts** - Direct database media insertion
   - Bypasses Payload upload API to avoid miniflare bug
   - Creates media records pointing to R2 files

3. **scripts/link-page-media.ts** - Links pages to media
   - Matches media by filename between old and new databases
   - Updates page_image_id and thumbnail_image_id relationships

4. **scripts/populate-media-metadata.ts** - Populates missing metadata
   - Reads files from disk
   - Extracts filesize, width, height using Sharp
   - Updates database records

5. **scripts/upload-media-to-r2.sh** - Upload to remote R2
   - Uploads all media files to production R2 bucket

6. **scripts/upload-media-to-local-r2.sh** - Upload to local R2
   - Uploads all media files to miniflare's simulated R2

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Miniflare R2 Upload Bug
**Issue**: Uploading files through Payload API fails with `AssertionError: false == true` in miniflare's devalue serialization.

**Workaround**: Direct database insertion + separate R2 upload scripts.

**Impact**: Thumbnails not generated during migration. Will need to be batch-generated later.

**Files Affected**: Lines 102-103 in miniflare's `devalue.ts`

### Separate Local/Remote R2
**Issue**: Local dev uses miniflare's simulated R2, which is completely separate from production R2.

**Solution**: Files must be uploaded to both:
- Local R2 (no `--remote` flag) for local dev
- Remote R2 (with `--remote` flag) for production

## Database Status

### Local Database (`.wrangler/state/v3/d1`)
✅ Users: 2
✅ Comics: 1
✅ Chapters: 5
✅ Pages: 29
✅ Media: 42 (with complete metadata)

### Local R2 (miniflare)
✅ 42 original images uploaded

### Remote R2 (Cloudflare)
✅ 42 original images uploaded

## What's Missing

1. **Thumbnails** - Need to be batch-generated
   - 7 sizes per image (294 total thumbnails needed)
   - Will be generated in a future step

2. **Remote D1 Sync** - Local database needs to be synced to production
   - Run migrations against remote D1
   - Export/import data to remote D1

## Testing Status

✅ Users can login with temporary passwords
✅ Pages display in admin UI
✅ Media records appear in admin UI
✅ Media files serve correctly at `/api/media/file/:filename`
✅ Page-media relationships display correctly
✅ File metadata displays correctly (filesize, dimensions)

## Next Steps

1. Generate thumbnails for all media (batch operation)
2. Sync local database to remote D1
3. Verify production deployment works
4. Implement frontend API endpoints
5. Test CORS with frontend
6. Document API specifications

## Backup & Recovery

All schema and data are backed up in:
- `backups/SCHEMA-DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete schema reference
- `backups/RECOVERY-INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Step-by-step recovery
- `backups/temp-passwords-*.txt` - User login credentials
- `scripts/backup-database.sh` - Automated backup script

## Notes

- Payload UI bug reported: Password change button mislabeled as "Force Unlock"
- User passwords are temporary - users should reset after first login
- Local dev uses miniflare; production uses real Cloudflare Workers
