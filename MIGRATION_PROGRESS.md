# Chimera CMS Migration Progress

## Overview
Migration from chimera-cms (PostgreSQL + local storage) to chimera-d1 (Cloudflare D1 + R2) using Payload CMS v3.

**Status**: ✅ Successfully deployed to production and fully operational!

---

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Migration
- ✅ Created Payload CMS collections matching chimera-cms structure
- ✅ Generated and applied Drizzle ORM migrations
- ✅ Schema includes 15 tables with proper foreign key relationships
- ✅ Created 60 indexes for performance optimization

**Collections Created**:
- `comics` - Main comic series information
- `chapters` - Chapter organization within comics
- `pages` - Individual comic pages with navigation
- `media` - Image files with thumbnail variants
- `comics_credits` - Creator credits (writer, artist, colorist, etc.)
- `users` - Authentication and authorization
- Payload system tables (migrations, preferences, locked documents, sessions)

### 2. Local Development Environment
- ✅ Local D1 database populated with all content
- ✅ Local R2 bucket with all media files
- ✅ Miniflare configured for local development
- ✅ Dev server running successfully on http://localhost:3333

**Local Database Contents**:
- 1 comic ("The Automan's Daughter")
- 5 chapters
- 29 pages
- 42 media files
- 3 creator credits
- 2 users

### 3. Media File Processing
- ✅ Migrated all original images from chimera-cms
- ✅ Generated 7 thumbnail sizes per image (294 thumbnails total):
  - `thumbnail` - Medium preview (1600px width)
  - `thumbnail_small` - Small preview (1600px width)
  - `webcomic_page` - Full page display (1600px width)
  - `webcomic_mobile` - Mobile optimized (1600px width)
  - `cover_image` - Cover art display (1600px width)
  - `social_preview` - Social media preview (1600px width)
  - `avatar` - Small icon (1600px width)
- ✅ All thumbnails uploaded to local R2
- ✅ All thumbnails uploaded to remote R2
- ✅ Media records updated with thumbnail metadata (URLs, dimensions, filesizes)

**Thumbnail Generation Tool**: Custom WASM-based Jimp implementation in `/src/lib/generateImageSizesJimp.ts`

### 4. Remote D1 Database Setup
- ✅ Created remote D1 database: `chimera-d1` (ID: 79308db7-d924-4126-9794-df01af62c0ba)
- ✅ Uploaded schema (15 tables, 60 indexes)
- ✅ Synced all data from local to remote D1
- ✅ Verified data integrity (row counts, UUIDs, relationships)

**Remote Database Contents** (verified):
```
comics:          1 row  ✅
chapters:        5 rows ✅
pages:          29 rows ✅
media:          42 rows ✅
comics_credits:  3 rows ✅
users:           2 rows ✅
```

### 5. API Testing
Tested all core APIs with remote D1:
- ✅ `/api/comics` - Returns comic data with credits (1825ms)
- ✅ `/api/media` - Returns media with thumbnails (22ms)
- ✅ `/api/pages` - Returns pages with relationships (39ms)
- ✅ All UUIDs preserved
- ✅ All foreign key relationships working

### 6. Configuration Management
- ✅ `wrangler.jsonc` configured for both local and remote modes
- ✅ Environment switching tested (local ↔ remote)
- ✅ R2 bucket bindings configured
- ✅ D1 database bindings configured
- ✅ Added observability logging configuration for production debugging

### 7. Production Deployment & Issue Resolution
- ✅ Deployed to Cloudflare Workers (https://chimera-d1.mike-17c.workers.dev)
- ✅ Fixed critical runtime error: `Error: No such module "wrangler"`
  - **Issue**: `payload.config.ts` was importing wrangler module in production runtime
  - **Root Cause**: Conditional logic wasn't properly detecting Cloudflare Workers environment
  - **Solution**: Changed detection to use `navigator.userAgent === 'Cloudflare-Workers'`
  - **File Modified**: `src/payload.config.ts` lines 20-28
- ✅ Verified all APIs working in production
- ✅ Verified admin interface accessible (HTTP 200)

**Key Learning**: The wrangler module is only available during local development via `getPlatformProxy()`. In production Workers runtime, Cloudflare context is provided by OpenNext through `getCloudflareContext()`.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Export/Import Process
1. **Schema Export**: Extracted CREATE TABLE and CREATE INDEX statements from local D1
2. **Schema Upload**: Uploaded to remote D1 via wrangler CLI
3. **Data Export**: Generated INSERT statements from local database
4. **Foreign Key Handling**: Wrapped INSERTs with `PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF/ON`
5. **Data Upload**: Successfully uploaded 82 SQL statements (80 INSERTs + 2 PRAGMAs)

**Key Files**:
- `/tmp/tables-only.sql` - 199 lines, 15 CREATE TABLE statements
- `/tmp/indexes-only.sql` - 60 lines, 60 CREATE INDEX statements
- `/tmp/data-no-transaction.sql` - 82 lines, content data

### Schema Differences from Chimera-CMS
- Added `uuid` column to all main tables (comics, chapters, pages, media)
- Maintained normalized relationships using foreign keys (consistent with PostgreSQL approach)
- Added navigation fields to pages (previous_page_id, next_page_id, is_first_page, is_last_page)
- Kept credits in junction table structure
- Media thumbnails stored as JSON array in D1

### Cloudflare D1 Limitations Encountered
1. ❌ Cannot use `BEGIN TRANSACTION` in SQL files (use native APIs instead)
2. ❌ Cannot use UNION ALL with many terms (limit appears to be ~5)
3. ✅ PRAGMA statements work for foreign key control
4. ✅ SQLite .dump format compatible with modifications

### Cloudflare Workers Runtime Constraints
1. ❌ Cannot import `wrangler` module at runtime (only available in local dev)
2. ✅ Must use `getCloudflareContext()` for accessing D1/R2 bindings in production
3. ✅ Detect Workers environment via `navigator.userAgent === 'Cloudflare-Workers'`
4. ⚠️ Build warnings about `eval()` usage are non-blocking (from Payload migrations system)
